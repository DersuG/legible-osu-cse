# legible-osu-cse
A [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) theme for the Ohio State University's CSE [curriculum site](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/).

# Why?
Currently, OSU's CSE curriculum site is mostly unstyled xhtml. Some course-specific pages have almost no styling at all. This means the text spans the *full width of the screen*. From their perspective, it's probably for maximum backwards-compatability. From a typographical perspective, this seriously impedes readability. From my perspective, it's just plain annoying.

# Usage
1. Install a userstyles browser extension. I use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). Please avoid Styl*ish*, a different userstyles extension. It violates your privacy and sells your data for profit.
2. Go to OSU's CSE curriculum site, at http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/
3. Create a new style in Stylus. Set the url to `http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/`.
4. Paste the contents of `style.css` into the editor and save.
